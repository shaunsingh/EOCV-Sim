# Welcome!

EOCV-Sim (EasyOpenCV Simulator) is a straightforward way to test your pipelines in a 
simple user interface directly in your computer, simulating the EasyOpenCV library & a bit of
FTC SDK structure, allowing you to simply copy paste directly your pipeline code once you want to 
transfer it onto your robot!

### If you'd like to learn how to use the simulator, you can find a complete usage explaination [here](https://github.com/serivesmejia/EOCV-Sim/blob/master/USAGE.md)

# Compatibility

Since OpenCV in Java uses a native library, which is platform specific, the simulator is currently limited to the following platforms:

* Windows x64 (tested)
* Windows x32 (untested)
* MacOS x64 (tested)
* Linux x64 (tested for Ubuntu 20.04)<br/>

# Installation

## Recommended installation method (IntelliJ IDEA)

No complicated setup is required, straight up importing the project into IntelliJ IDEA:

1) **Download & install the Java Development Kit if you haven't already:**<br/><br/>
      JDK 8 is the minimum required one, any JDK above that version will probably work fine.<br/>
      You can download it from [the Oracle webpage](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html),
      and here is a [step by step video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ-PJbvJBGs) of the installation process<br/>

2) **Download & install IntelliJ IDEA Community IDE if you haven't already:**<br/><br/>
      You can download it from the JetBrains webpage (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)<br/>
      Here is another great [step by step video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2okEJIbUYs) for IntelliJ installation.
     
3) **Clone and import the project:**<br/>

      1) Open IntelliJ IDEA and in the main screen click on "Get from Version Control"<br/>
      
            <img src='doc/images/eocvsim_screenshot_installation_1.png' width='399' height='249'><br/><br/>
         Alternatively, if you already had another project opened, go to File > New > Project from Version Control...<br/><br/>
            <img src='doc/images/eocvsim_screenshot_installation_2.png' width='419' height='76'>
            
      2) Another window will show up for cloning and importing a repository into IntelliJ<br/>
      
         1) In the "URL" field, enter: ```https://github.com/serivesmejia/EOCV-Sim.git```<br/>
         2) The directory can be changed, but it will be automatically filled so it's not necessary.
         3) Make sure the "Version control" is set to "Git".<br/><br/>
			<img src='doc/images/eocvsim_screenshot_installation_3.png' width='50%' height='50%'><br/>
         4) After that, click on the "Clone" button, located at the bottom right and the cloning process will begin...<br/>    
			<img src='doc/images/eocvsim_screenshot_installation_4.png' width='50%' height='50%'><br/>
         5) After the cloning finishes, the project should automatically import and you'll have something like this:<br/><br/>
            <img src='doc/images/eocvsim_screenshot_installation_5.png' width='75%' height='75%'><br/>
            
### And you're ready to go! Refer to the [usage explanation](https://github.com/serivesmejia/EOCV-Sim/blob/master/USAGE.md) for further details on how to utilize the simulator.<br/>

## From the command-line

   1) Clone EOCV-Sim repo and cd to the cloned folder
   
	 git clone https://github.com/serivesmejia/EOCV-Sim.git
	 cd EOCV-Sim
   \**Or it can also be manually downloaded as a ZIP file from GitHub*<br/>

   2) Run EOCV-Sim through gradle:
  
	 gradlew runSim
	 
   \**On some command lines (like Windows PowerShell) you might need to execute "./gradlew" instead*<br/>
	 
#### And that's it! You might need to wait a bit for gradle to download all the dependencies but EOCV-Sim will open eventually.
	 
## From repl.it

   1) Click [here](https://repl.it/github/serivesmejia/EOCV-Sim) to go to repl.it, you might require to create an account if you haven't already. Once you do that, it will automatically create a new project and start cloning the EOCV-Sim repo.
 
   2) After the cloning is finished, click on the green "Run" button at the top and EOCV-Sim should start.
  
   \**Please note that this method is not widely supported and you might run into some issues or lack of some functionality.*<br/>

# Change logs

### [v2.2.1 - JVM crashing hotfix](https://github.com/serivesmejia/releases/tag/v2.2.0)
 
   - This is the 8th release for EOCV-Sim
   
      - Changelog:
        - Removed "Java memory" message in the title since it's practically useless for the end user
        - Updated to Gradle 7.0 for Java 16+ support (#25)

      - Bugfixes:
        - Fixed JVM crashing error caused by releasing all mats in a MatRecycler finalization (#26)
        - Improved memory usage by deleting unused BufferedImageRecyclers, memory is now slightly freed when allocating or recycling buffered images of different sizes (which means that the memory usage is reduced a little bit when zooming in the viewport)

### [v2.2.0 - Variable Tuner Upgrade](https://github.com/serivesmejia/releases/tag/v2.2.0)
 
   - This is the 7th release for EOCV-Sim

      - Changelog:
 
        - Pipelines now have a timeout all of the three methods so that the main loop doesn't get compromised due to a "stuck" pipeline (using kotlin coroutines)
  	    - processFrame has a timeout of 4.2 seconds
  	    - init is executed in the same scope as processFrame, when it has to be called, the timeout is doubled (16.4)
  	    - When either processFrame or init methods timeout, the sim automatically falls back to the default pipeline and discards any frame that the old timeouted pipeline could return.
  	    - onViewportTapped is still called from the U.I Thread, but it now has a timeout of 4.2 seconds too
        - Added EnumField which handles the type Enum (accepts all classes of type enum, including the ones declared by the user)
        - Major improvements to the variable tuner, added new features for color picking, tuning with sliders, configuration... See [usage explanation](https://github.com/serivesmejia/EOCV-Sim/blob/master/USAGE.md) for further details.
        - GUI improvement: Dropped some external dialogs in favor of simple "popups" for more practicality
        - Internals:
    		- Continued rewrite to kotlin
    		- Splitted visualizer class components into different classes
    		- Improved EventHandler doOnce listeners

### [v2.1.0 - Video Update](https://github.com/serivesmejia/EOCV-Sim/releases/tag/v2.1.0)

   - This is the 6th release for EOCV-Sim

      - Changelog: 

        - Added support for VideoSources! You can now input your pipeline with a moving video (*.avi format is the most supported and tested, other codecs might depend on the OS you're using)
        - Added support for video recording, accessible at the bottom of the pipeline selector. Save format is AVI
        - Added a new TunableField type: RectField, which handles the OpenCV type "Rect" (might be useful for rect pipelines ðŸ‘€)
        - Improved uncaught exception handling and added a crash report generator
        - Added support for more themes from FlatLaf
        - Added new config option to change the output video recording size
        - Added support for EOCV's TimestampedOpenCvPipeline
        - Internals:
    		- Major rewrite to kotlin! (Still mostly Java but that might change soon)
    		- A bit of code cleaning and restructuring

        - Fixes UnsupportedOperationException with the TaskBar API in some operating system
            
### [v2.0.1 - BooleanField hotfix](https://github.com/serivesmejia/EOCV-Sim/releases/tag/v2.0.1)
      
  - This is the 4th release for EOCV-Sim.

      - Bugfixes:
      
        - Fixes ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when initial value of a boolean field was true which would make the sim enter into a frozen state.

### [v2.0.0 - Major Update](https://github.com/serivesmejia/EOCV-Sim/releases/tag/v2.0.0)
      
 - This is the 3rd release for EOCV-Sim.

      - Changelog:

        - Added variable tuner for public non-final supported fields in the pipeline, accessible on the bottom part of the image viewport.
        - Pipeline pause and resume option to save resources, pauses automatically with image sources for one-shot analysis
        - Top Menu bar containing new features/convenient shortcuts:
          - Save Mat to disk option in File submenu
          - Restart feature in File submenu
          - Shortcut for creating input sources under File -> New -> Input Source
          - Settings menu under Edit submenu
          - "About" information screen under Help submenu
          - Appereance themes via the FlatLaf library, selectable in the settings window
        - Telemetry now is passed to the pipeline via the constructor rather than an instance variable, check usage explaination for further details
        - Mat visualizing into the viewport is now handled in another thread to improve performance
        - Pipeline FPS are now capped at 30
        - Zooming viewport is now supported, using mouse wheel while holding Ctrl key
        
      - Bugfixes:
        
        - Removed call to the gc in the main loop due to performance issues
        - Fixed BufferedImage mem leak by recycling previously used buffered images and trying to flush them
        - Some internal code cleaning & reestructuration
        - Fixed issues with native lib loading (mostly on Mac) with the OpenCV package provided by OpenPnP
     
### [v1.1.0 - Telemetry Update](https://github.com/serivesmejia/EOCV-Sim/releases/tag/v1.1.0)
      
 - This is the 2rd release for EOCV-Sim.
      
      - Changelog:

        - Added a Telemetry implementation displayed in the UI. Replicates the FTC SDK one, it can be used directly in pipelines.
        - Added an option to define the CameraSource resolution when creation.
        - Added MacOS support (thnx Noah)
        - Changed default resolution to 320x280 everywhere since it is the most commonly used in EOCV
        - Native libs are now downloaded by the simulator from another GitHub repo to avoid bloating the repository with heavy files
        - Java libraries, such as classgraph, opencv and gson are now delivered in compiled jars to improve compile times
       
      - Bug fixes:
       
        - Fixed a bug where the InputSources would return a BGR Mat instead of RGB, which is the type EOCV gives.
        - Regarding the last point, the visualizer now expects for the given mats to be RGB
        - Improved general IO error handling everywhere, from file accessing to input sources reading, so that the simulator doesnâ€™t enter in a freeze state if any IO related operation fails
        - Improved multi threading handling for changing pipelines and inputsources.
        - Fixed issue in Linux where the buttons would be moved to an incorrect position when resizing out and then trying to resize back to the original size
 
 
### [v1.0.0 - Initial Release](https://github.com/serivesmejia/EOCV-Sim/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
      
 - Initial EOCV-Sim release.
